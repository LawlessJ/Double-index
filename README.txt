This short code takes a list and an idexed portion of that list as arguments. If the index put into the function is valid, it will double that element, and return the new list. If it is not a valid index, the function will simply return the list. Note the operator *=, the main reason this is being saved. lst[index] *= 2 is the same thing as writing lst[index = lst[index * 2.  Also of note: the if statement purposefully is worded that the index is BOTH greater than the length of the given list and the NEGATIVE of the length of the given list, so that reverse indexes (such as lst[-2], taking the second to last element of the list) can be implemented in this function.
The output of any created list will be the same list, with the element indexed doubled but maintained in its original list order.
